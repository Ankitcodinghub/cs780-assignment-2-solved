Read all the instructions below carefully before you start working on the assignment.

â€¢ The purpose of this course is that you learn RL and the best way to do that is by implementation and experimentation.

â€¢ The assignment requires your to implement some algorithms and you are required report your findings after experimenting with those algorithms. The report should be submitted in pdf format.

â€¢ In case your solution is found to have an overlap with solution by someone else (including external sources), all the parties involved will get zero in this and all future assignments plus further more penalties in the overall grade. We will check not just for lexical but also semantic overlap. Same applies for the code as well. Even an iota of cheating would NOT be tolerated. If you cheat one line or cheat one page the penalty would be same.

â€¢ Be a smart agent, think long term, if you cheat we will discover it somehow, the price you would be paying is not worth it.

â€¢ You have to submit your assignment via following Google Form (link above)

â€¢ Since the assignment involves experimentation, reporting your results and observations, there is a lot of scope for creativity and innovation and presenting new perspectives. Such efforts would be highly appreciated and accordingly well rewarded. Be an exploratory agent!

â€¢ In your plots, have a clear legend and clear lines, etc. Of course you would generating the plots in your code but you must also put these plots in your notebook. Generate high resolution pdf/svg version of the plots so that it doesnâ€™t pixilate on zooming.

â€¢ For all experiments, report about the seed used in the code documentation, write about the seed used.

â€¢ In your notebook write about all things that are not obvious from the code e.g., if you have made any assumptions, references/sources, running time, etc.

â€¢ In addition to checking your code and report, very likely, we will be conducting one-on-one viva for the evaluation. So please make sure that you do not cheat!

â€¢ Use of LLMs based tools or AI-based code tools is strictly prohibited! Use of ChatGPT, VS Code, Gemini, CO-Pilot, etc. is not allowed. NOTE VS code is also not allowed. Even in Colab disable the AI assistant. If you use it, we will know it very easily. Use of any of the tools would be counted as cheating and would be given a ZERO, with no questions asked.

Random-Maze Environment

+1 3

5 6 H

-1 7

S 8 9 10 11

Living Penalty of -0.04

(a) Maze Environment (b) Maze Environment Transitions

In this assignment we will be exploring a variant of the Random Maze Environment (RME) that we have been looking in the lectures. The environment is represented as a grid world in Figure 1a. Random maze environment is a highly stochastic environment with 11 states: two terminal states (a goal state (G) and a hole state (H)) and 9 non-terminal states and a wall in between the environment. The wall behaves similar to the wall on the periphery of the environment, basically if an agent bumps against the wall, it bounces back. The boundary of the environment behaves similarly, if an agent hits the boundary it bounces back. The agent receives a reward of +1 when it lands in the goal state (3) and it receives a reward of -1 when it lands in the hole state (7). For rest of the transitions there is a reward of -0.04. Essentially the agent has the living cost of -0.04. The transitions are stochastic as shown in Figure 1b. In this environment, four actions are possible: left, top, right, and bottom. For every intended action, there is 80% chance of going in the intended direction and remaining 20% chances of going in either of the orthogonal directions. The 20% chance gets equally distributed between each of the orthogonal direction. The agent starts from state 8 (S). Assume Î³ = 0.99 for the problems below.

In this assignment we will be looking at control algorithms we learnt in Lectures. For each of the plot, create the legend on the left/right side so that it doesnâ€™t overlay on the plot. For all the algorithms below, this time we will not be specifying the hyper-parameters, please play with the hyper-params to come up with the best values. This way you will learn to tune the model. As you are aware from your past experience, single run of the algorithm over the environment results in plots that have lot of variance and look very noisy. One way to overcome this is to create several different instances of the environment using different seeds and then average out the results across these and plot these. For all the plots below, you this strategy.

Basically implement the following function that would return the policy success percentage. As you are training the agent, at each episode, you will have a version of the policy, use that policy along with the function below to get the policy success rate.
